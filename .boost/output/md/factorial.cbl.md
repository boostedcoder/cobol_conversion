### Boost Code Explanation

Last Updated: Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 12:26:43 PM PDT

The code you provided is written in COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language), a programming language that is primarily used in business, finance, and administrative systems.

The program calculates the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

Here is a detailed explanation of the code:

1. **IDENTIFICATION DIVISION and PROGRAM-ID**: This is the program identification section where the program is named.

2. **DATA DIVISION and WORKING-STORAGE SECTION**: In this section, all the variables used in the program are declared.

3. **PROCEDURE DIVISION**: This division contains the actual logic of the program.

4. **ACCEPT CMD-ARGS FROM COMMAND-LINE**: The program accepts a command-line argument and stores it in the variable `CMD-ARGS`.

5. It then checks if `CMD-ARGS` is alphabetic. If it is, it performs `ERROR-PARA` which displays an error message and stops the program.

6. If `CMD-ARGS` is not alphabetic, it converts `CMD-ARGS` to its numeric value and stores it in `DECINUM`. If `DECINUM` is negative, it performs `ERROR-PARA`.

7. The decimal number is then moved to a non-decimal number (`NUM`). If `NUM` and `DECINUM` are equal, it means the input was an integer.

8. If `NUM` is 0 or 1, it displays 1 and stops the program because the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1.

9. If `NUM` is greater than 1, it calculates the factorial of `NUM` by repeatedly multiplying `FACTORIAL` by `CNT` (which starts at 1 and is incremented by 1 each time) until `CNT` is greater than `NUM`.

10. It then left justifies the result by tallying the number of leading zeros in `FACTORIAL` and moving the characters in `FACTORIAL` from the position after the leading zeros to `LEFT-JUST-NUMBER`.

11. Finally, it displays the left justified result and stops the program.

12. If `NUM` and `DECINUM` are not equal, it means the input was not an integer and it performs `ERROR-PARA`.

The algorithm used in this code is a simple loop that calculates the factorial of a number. It does not use any special algorithms or data structures.

For more information on COBOL, you can visit this link: [COBOL tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cobol/index.htm)

As per your architectural guidelines, this code doesn't conflict with any special constraints or guidelines since none were provided. It's a standalone COBOL program that performs a specific task.

### Boost Flow Diagram

CMD-ARGS-- NUMERIC -->DECINUM;

DISPLAY-- STOP RUN;
ERROR-PARA-- DISPLAY -->STOP RUN;
```

The control flow graph above represents the control flow of the given source code. The primary path is shown in green, while the error path is shown in red.

The control flow starts at the `CMD-ARGS` block, where the command-line arguments are accepted. If the `CMD-ARGS` is alphabetic, the control flow goes to the `ERROR-PARA` block, which displays an error message and stops the program.

If the `CMD-ARGS` is numeric, the control flow goes to the `DECINUM` block, where the command-line argument is converted to its numeric value. If the `DECINUM` is less than 0, the control flow goes to the `ERROR-PARA` block, which displays an error message and stops the program.

If the `DECINUM` is greater than or equal to 0, the control flow goes to the `NUM` block, where the decimal number is moved to the non-decimal number `NUM`. If the `NUM` is equal to the `DECINUM`, the control flow goes to the `EQUAL TO` block.

If the `NUM` is equal to 0 or 1, the control flow goes to the `DISPLAY` block, which displays 1 and stops the program. If the `NUM` is greater than 1, the control flow goes to the `CALC-FACT` block, where the factorial is calculated until `CNT` is greater than `NUM`.

After the factorial calculation, the control flow goes to the `DISPLAY` block, which displays the left-justified result of the factorial. Finally, the control flow stops the program.

If any of the conditions are not met, the control flow goes to the `ERROR-PARA` block, which displays an error message and stops the program.

### Boost Source-Level Performance Analysis

Last Updated: Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 12:27:42 PM PDT

1. **Severity**: 4/10

   **Line Number**: 14

   **Bug Type**: CPU

   **Description**: The use of FUNCTION NUMVAL for converting string to number is CPU-intensive. This function performs a lot of unnecessary checks for a simple integer conversion.

   **Solution**: Use a simpler conversion function or method if available in the COBOL version you are using. If not, consider writing a custom conversion routine that does the bare minimum required for your specific use case.


2. **Severity**: 6/10

   **Line Number**: 33

   **Bug Type**: CPU

   **Description**: The factorial calculation is done using a loop which is not efficient for large numbers. This can lead to high CPU usage and long execution times.

   **Solution**: Consider using a more efficient algorithm for calculating factorial. For example, you could use a recursive function or utilize a memoization technique to store previously calculated results. However, be aware that recursion in COBOL can be tricky and may not be supported in all versions.


3. **Severity**: 3/10

   **Line Number**: 40

   **Bug Type**: Memory

   **Description**: The INSPECT TALLYING FOR LEADING ZEROS operation is not efficient as it scans the entire string. This can be memory-intensive for large strings.

   **Solution**: Consider using a more efficient method to remove leading zeros. For example, you could write a loop that iterates over the string from the beginning and stops when it encounters a non-zero character.
