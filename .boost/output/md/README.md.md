# Sample Programs in Cobol

Welcome to Sample Programs in Cobol! To find documentation related to the Cobol code in this repo, look [here.](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/cobol)

## Sample Programs List - 4/37 :disappointed:

In this section, we feature a list of completed and missing programs in Cobol. See above for the current amount of completed programs in Cobol. If you see a program that is missing and would like to add it, please submit an issue, so we can assign it to you.

### Completed Programs

Below, you'll find a list of completed code snippets in Cobol. Code snippets preceded by :warning: link to a GitHub issue query featuring a possible article request issue. If an article request issue doesn't exist, we encourage you to create one. Meanwhile, code snippets preceded by :white_check_mark: link to an existing article which provides further documentation. To see the list of approved projects, check out the official Sample Programs projects list.

## Testing

The following list shares details about what we're using to test all Sample Programs in Cobol.

- Docker Image: esolang/cobol
- Docker Tag: latest

See the [Glotter2 project](https://github.com/rzuckerm/glotter2) for more information on how to create a testinfo file.

### Boost Code Explanation

Last Updated: Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 12:23:00 PM PDT

This is not an executable code but rather a markdown document that serves as a guide or documentation for a repository of COBOL sample programs. It provides information on both completed and missing programs in the repository. 

The markdown document contains:

1. A welcome message and a link to documentation related to the COBOL code in the repository.

2. A list of completed programs with links to the code snippets and their requirements. The completed programs are marked with a white check mark or a warning sign, indicating whether an article request issue exists or not.

3. A list of missing programs along with links to open an issue in GitHub and check out the description of the project. The missing programs are marked with a cross.

4. Information on how the sample programs in COBOL are tested, including the Docker image and tag used.

5. A link to the Glotter2 project for more information on how to create a testinfo file.

6. A link to support the project on Github.

In terms of architecture, this document serves as a guide to both contributors and users of the repository, providing an overview of the current status of the project and how to contribute to it. 

As for the algorithms used, since this is a markdown document and not an executable code, we can't talk about algorithms. However, the document refers to several algorithms that are either implemented or need to be implemented in COBOL, such as Binary Search, Bubble Sort, Depth First Search, Dijkstra, and others. 

You can learn more about COBOL from the provided link: [https://sampleprograms.io/languages/cobol](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/cobol).

### Boost Flow Diagram

Last Updated: Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 12:23:11 PM PDT

```mermaid
graph TD;
style Start fill:#228B22, stroke:#000000, stroke-width:2px;
style External fill:#FFA500, stroke:#000000, stroke-width:2px;
style Error fill:#B22222, stroke:#000000, stroke-width:2px;

Start-->External;
Start-->Error;
```

The control flow graph for the given source code is as follows:

- The start of the graph is the function name being analyzed, which is not available in the given source code.
- There is control flow to an external library or non-standard function, represented by the "External" flow block.
- There is also control flow to an error path, represented by the "Error" flow block.
