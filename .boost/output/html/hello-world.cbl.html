<p>Last Updated: Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 12:21:04 PM PDT</p>
<p>The code you provided is written in COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language). COBOL is a high-level programming language first developed by the CODASYL Committee (Conference on Data Systems Languages) in the early 1960s. It was designed for business data processing needs and is still in use in many financial and business applications today.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a breakdown of the code:</p>
<pre><code>IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
</code></pre><p>This is a mandatory division in every COBOL program. It identifies the program.</p>
<pre><code>PROGRAM-ID. HELLO-WORLD.
</code></pre><p>This is a mandatory paragraph in the IDENTIFICATION DIVISION. It gives the program a name, in this case, &quot;HELLO-WORLD&quot;.</p>
<pre><code>PROCEDURE DIVISION.
</code></pre><p>This is where the actual code that the computer will execute is written. It is also a mandatory division in every COBOL program.</p>
<pre><code>DISPLAY &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
</code></pre><p>This is a simple command that outputs the string &quot;Hello, World!&quot; to the console.</p>
<pre><code>STOP RUN.
</code></pre><p>This statement is used to stop the program.</p>
<p>The algorithm used in this code is extremely simple: it just displays a message and then ends. There is no complex computation or data manipulation.</p>
<p>As for the architectural guidelines, since there were no special guidelines or constraints provided, this code doesn&#39;t conflict with any. It is a simple, standalone program, and doesn&#39;t interact with any other systems or software.</p>

style ExampleProcess fill:#228B22, stroke:#000000, stroke-width:4px;

Start-->ExampleProcess;</pre>
</code></pre><p>The control flow graph for the given source code is a simple linear flow. The program starts at the &quot;Start&quot; node and proceeds to the &quot;ExampleProcess&quot; node, where the &quot;DISPLAY&quot; statement is executed to display the message &quot;Hello, World!&quot;. After that, the program ends.</p>
